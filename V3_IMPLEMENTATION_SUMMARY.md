3. **Autonomous Feedback Loop**
   - Newly verified sites automatically become seed URLs
   - Exponential discovery capability through self-feeding system
   - Configurable feedback controls to prevent runaway crawling

4. **V2 Integration Pipeline**
   - Seamless integration maintaining V2 verification accuracy
   - High-confidence AI predictions (>70%) go to V2 verification

    "soccer stream reddit",
    "NBA live stream free",
    "MLB streaming sites",
    "NHL hockey stream"
  ]
}
```

## üö¶ Usage Examples

### Command Line Operation
```bash
# Traditional V2 mode
python scout.py v2

# Autonomous V3 mode
python scout.py v3

# Hybrid mode (recommended for maximum coverage)
python scout.py hybrid
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from scout import SignalScout

# Initialize with V3 capabilities
scout = SignalScout()

# Run hybrid discovery cycle
results = scout.run_discovery_cycle(mode='hybrid')

# Check if V3 is available
if scout.v3_engine:
    v3_results = scout.v3_engine.run_autonomous_discovery_cycle()
```
